# dist is created during the Docker build, so it should not be ignored here if we copy '.'
# However, if your build process relies on a pre-built dist, adjust accordingly.
# For now, assuming 'npm run build' in Dockerfile handles it.

# Input PDF and intermediate JSON files
# If Viikkopelit_*.pdf and parsed_pdf_data.json are only build-time artifacts
# and not needed by the running app, they can be ignored.
# extracted_games_output.json is needed by the app, so it should NOT be ignored.
